A Google Sheets Apps Script I created for Red Apple Academy.

![Example](https://github.com/tjacobko/in-and-out-scanner/blob/main/In-and-Out-Sample.JPG)

### How it works

Scan a student's ID into the top row of the sheet. The student's name and date+time will automatically be recorded depending on if they are entering or leaving the campus.
